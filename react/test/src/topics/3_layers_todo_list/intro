Splitting a Single Page Application into layers has a set of advantages:
1. a better separation of concerns
2. the layer implementation can be replaced
3. the UI layer can be hard to test. By moving the logic to other layers, it becomes easier to test.
Three main layers:
1. UI (aka Presentation)
2. Domain (aka Business)
3. Data Access
